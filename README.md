# CocktailsSwiftUI
SwiftUI App

This app is the SwiftUI rewrite of https://github.com/VictorRiurean/Cocktails

You can see a screen recording of the app's functionality here https://youtu.be/vC_i__hAQA4

The error you are seeing after tapping  "Surprize me" in the Discover scene is due to the fact that the
random cocktail endpoint can sometimes return one that you cannot find when calling the search endpoint.
